# Save the Princess â€“ HackerRank Bot Challenge (JavaScript)

This project contains a solution to the classic [HackerRank "Bot Saves Princess"](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/saveprincess) problem using JavaScript.

The project aim is to help the bot (`m`) find the shortest path to a princess (`p`) who is supposed to be in one of the four corners of the grid.

## Problem Summary

- You're given an odd-dimension square grid (e.g., 3x3, 5x5).
- The grid contains:
  - A bot located in the center (`m`)
  - A princess located in one of the corners (`p`)
- You must print the path the bot should take to reach the princess, one move per line (`UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`) in a single output using \n.
